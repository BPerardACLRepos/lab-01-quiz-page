            <p id="history-content">
                Kickball was originally invented as a playground sport for soccer players who lacked the upper-body
                strength required for dodgeball. However, in the early 90's, Generation X ironically adopted it as an
                "adult" sport for people who hated adult sports, but liked alcohol; this would remain largely unchanged
                for the next ten years. In the year 2000, MTV made the choice to pivot from music to reality television,
                and hosted the first "adult" kickball tournament featuring people (mainly B-level celebrities and
                artists featured on "Jock Jams") who were actually trying to win. This would alter the trajectory of
                "adult" kickball, and usher in the age of the try-hard. Following this tournament, the spirit of
                kickball morphed from shrug-and-chug to a culture of "former athletes" who had knee injuries that
                prevented them from winning at flag football. Today, "adult" kickball is played by sub-par athletes at
                all levels of enthusiasm and drunkeness.

            <h2 id="rules-title">Rules of the Game</h2>
            <p id="rules-content">
                Kickball is a combination of America's most beloved (baseball) and most despised (football aka soccer)
                sports. The majority of the rules are from baseball, but the hard to hit and easy to throw ball is
                replaced with the recess red rubber ball that the batter attempts to kick. While most people play
                kickball with the slow, slightly bouncy schoolyard pitch, competitive leagues allow all kinds of
                trickery when getting the ball across the plate; the internet is rife with videos of hurt egos and butts
                from a swing-and-a-miss, look them up if you ever run out of cat videos. Throwing the ball at an
                offensive player in baseball probably starts a fight, but in "adult" kickball, this is considered an out
                and a way to shame your opponent. Other than that, it's straightforward enough for drunken adults to
                play, so you can pick it up pretty quickly.

            <h2 id="future-title">Future of Kickball</h2>
            <p id="future-content">
                At this point of time, kickball is played in leagues and tournaments across the nation. Unfortunately,
                that's about it. Unlike it's recess cousin, dodgeball, no other country has taken on "adult" kickball as
                a sport, and nothing is in the works to change that. Viral videos featured on ESPN have lead to interest
                from investors like Mark Cuban, however, when push came to shove, ESPN 8 (The Ocho) decided that "Cup
                Stacking" was a better choice. Another push for legitimization may be made at some point, but the ego of
                the "adult" kickball community will have to recover first.
